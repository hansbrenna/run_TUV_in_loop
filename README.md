# run_TUV_in_loop
compiled executable, python code and data for running the NCAR TUV model on gridded CESM1 output.

My only contribution is the python code to run TUV over a gridded file, and the code to reconstruct netcdf files from the ASCII output generated by TUV. I have not contributed to TUV development, but the source and compiled binary in included here for completeness. TUV has been compiled in batch mode.
